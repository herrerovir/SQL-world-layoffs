## Introduction
In this project, a global analysis of worldwide layoffs is performed using SQL to find valuable and useful information. 

The analysis workflow includes essential steps such as data loading, data cleaning, and data exploration using MySQL software.

## Goal
The overall purpose of this project is to explore the csv file dataset to obtain all relevant information about layoffs worldwide.

Once the schema is created and the dataset is loaded, it will be cleaned and preprocessed to undergo further exploration to obtain meaningful results.

By exploring and analyzing the data, we expect to find answers to the following points:

* Maximum amount of people laid off
* Maximum percentage of people laid off
* Count of companies that laid off everyone
* Companies that laid off everyone by number of people laid off
* Companies that closed down with the highes financing 
* Total sum of people laid off by companie
* Period of the layoffs
* Most affected industry
* Most affected country
* Year with most layoffs
* Status of the companies that laidoff
* Rolling total layoffs
* Top 5 companies with the most layoffs per year

## Project overview
   1. Data loading
   2. Data cleaning
   3. Data exploration
   4. Insights

## Dependencies
The following software is required to carry out this project:

* MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE

## Technical skills
The following skills were used throughout the implementation of this project:

* Database creation
* Data definition
* Data manipulation
* Data normalization
* Data querying

## Data set
The data for this analysis is loaded from a csv file which can be found uploaded in this repository.

The dataset consists of:
* 2361 entries
* 9 columns

## Data cleaning
Once the schema was created and the dataset was loaded into MySQL, it was required to clean it to ensure its integrity and reliability. 

Through MySQL's powerful query features, the raw, messy dataset was transformed into a clean, structured and reliable dataset suitable for further analysis.

## Data exploration
To obtain useful information from this dataset, an in-depth exploratory analysis was carried out. 

## Insights
The project successfully analyzed a large amount of data on layoffs worldwide. As expected from this project, the following questions were answered.

### **Maximum amount of people laid off**

The maximum amount of people laid off at once was: 12.000.

### **Maximum percentage of people laid off** 

The maximum percetage of people laid off was 1, which mean all the people in the company were fired.
